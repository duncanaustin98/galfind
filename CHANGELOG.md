- minor plotting changes
- small change to depth plot
- Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/u92876da/galfind into main

- Finished aperture corrections for MIRI. Still appears to be some nan's in the depths
- Updated galaxy.plot_cutouts to redefine the cutout axis for each galaxy.
- Need to assign galaxy.cutout_paths even if they've already been made
- Change to catalogue.make_cutouts to check if cutouts will be made before loading data in.

- Further testing of Data.from_pipeline() in prep for Rogiers' MACS-0416 photo-z's
- Finished updated Data.from_pipeline(). Should be semi-general but requires testing
- Minor Data.from_pipeline() updates
- Started update of Data.from_pipeline() to work for MIRI and in the more general case

- Minor fixes to loading in gal_band_mask and comments out calc_area_depth
- Merge pull request #85 from duncanaustin98/gal_instr
- Final minor update before merging
- Updated masking parameters. Should now work for COSMOS-Web but not generalized to be band dependent yet.
- Fixed issue with gal_band_mask being applied inappropriately when loading in cropped catalogue. Minor issues exist when catalogue IDs aren't integers starting from 1
- Pipeline runs without errors now. JEMS plotting doesn't show medium bands - major error somewhere.
- Updated EAZY .in templates to exclude bands without data from the SED fitting
- Load in speed now significantly faster. Loading full JOF catalogue with 16,000 sources and 1 SED fitting run takes 23.5s (and around 3s per EAZY SED run to load extras). Setting timed = False reduces time by approx. 5s. All previous v11 EAZY runs need to be re-done to update PDF/SED .h5 structure.
- Slight modification of EAZY PDF saving to halve the PDF load in speed. Could probably be improved even further by loading from .csv instead of a .h5 file.
- Loads in galaxy objects (pre-SED fitting) at a rate of 6,000 per second
- Merge pull request #84 from duncanaustin98/gal_instr-1
- Merge branch 'gal_instr' into gal_instr-1

- Minor update to Data.plot_area_depth()
- Fix to Data.calc_unmasked_area(), and implementing new depth diagnostic plot.
- Simple fix to aperture correction code
- Now loads in aperture corrections for Combined_Instrument much quicker. Structure of where aper_corrs is loaded in from is a bit clunky though. Depths were taking a while as it was plotting the large JADES image each time - this will now only plot the first time depths are run. Tested and JADES-matched now takes very little time to load in.
- Caching instrument aperture corrections
- fix to data
- Fix to aperture corrections
- Fix to Data for ACS_WFC
- Updated crop_by to allow for galaxy loading by "ID={galaxy_id}"
- General updates to BPASS [NII]/HÎ± ratio calculations using Xiao+18 BPASS v2.1+CLOUDY models
- Started updating cat_creator to include (and eventially save) gal_band_mask for the galaxies for speedy catalogue load in and instrument cropping.
- loading in catalogue now works properly, although it takes 10s for 1500 galaxy photometry entries
- Catalogue_creator.load_photometry updated to load photometry/errs for galaxies in the same catalogue with different available bands. Needs to propagate into galaxy specific instruments and loading input SED fitting catalogues.
- Merge pull request #81 from duncanaustin98/EW_calc
- Merge branch 'main' into EW_calc
- xi ion calculations (and kwarg saving into fits ext) now works when calculating for a single sample. Should extend this to increase iters and to multiple samples.
- Still need to sort out rest/obs frames for xi_ion calculations :( lol it's Friday so I'm pushing
- Re-written photometry_rest rest frame optical xi_ion etc calculations
- Updated pipeline to run COSMOS
- Minor corrections to A_Halpha dust corrections (switched the k(lambda) ratio so that it is now correct).
- Now allows for the deletion of a specific SED_rest_property from the catalogue without having to delete the entire extension. Useful for xi_ion testing!
- Final tests on xi_ion calculations.
- Works as long as you don't change the selection - needs a small overwrite in how this is run. Galaxy dependent kwargs should be written into the catalogue and SED_fit_params should be used to distinguish properties.
- Updated loading functions. Still need to update fits extension appending when the same SED rest property for multiple samples is calculated.
- Merge pull request #80 from duncanaustin98/excl_bands_fix
- Now dynamically adds all the band names in __init__ rather than requiring them to be typed. Instrument.__add__ updated, but should also include functionality to add an array of filter objects as well as an instrument. Data.from_pipeline() requires overhaul to generalize adding more instruments (e.g. so that NIRISS/MIRI don't need to be written here but instead use "for instr in instruments" rather than if/else)
- Beginning test of continuum measurements for EW calculations.
- bug fixes for Combined_Instrument and Instrument.remove_band()
- move msapexp imports to functions, to ensure package install is optional
- More minor selection bug fixes. Now just need to test xi_ion calculation.
- Fixed minor env dependent plotting issues to do with np.ndarray and list differences and EPOCHS_lowz sample selection
- Significant update to EW calculations from the rest-frame UV photometry. Fixed selection issue by ensuring that Catalgoue.gals remains a np.array rather than a list in __getitem__.
- EAZY/depth fixes should now be operational.
- Merge pull request #77 from duncanaustin98/JOF_Halpha
- Minor updates before merging
- Merge pull request #76 from duncanaustin98/load_spectroscopy

- Made Spectrum and Spectral_Catalogue objects to cross-match and load in spectra into Galaxy objects contained within the Catalogue object.
- plot fixed
- undo print statement
- fix depths code
- Started spectrum class

- Merge branch 'main' into SED_properties
- Updated UV line emitter selection functions
- Partway through writing select UV line emitters function.
- Updated galaxy Kokorev24_LRDs
- Added new colour selection criteria. Colour-colour, UVJ colour and Kokorev LRD selection half finished.
- Loads in default SED_fit_params_arr into cat cls upon instantiation
- Updated to pass default SED_fit_params_arr into cls upon instantiation.
- Catalogue_Base now no longer a list
- Loading in galaxy rest frame properties now works.
- Update requirement.txt and remove seaborn
- Minor changes
- Seem to have broken this bit :(
- Written loading functions but now this feature needs testing before continuing with photometric line EW calculations.
- SED properties now works for single selection only (although currently updates to cat_path -> _test.fits suffix). Still need to test combining multiple selections!
- Finished testing up to mUV calculation. This is too faint by about 4 mags, suspected unit issues.
- Beta fitting unit issue now fixed.
- Calculated beta is redder than it should be and takes too long to run, although the PDFs are now saving correctly.
- Saving PDFs now works, although they are all being saved as the same PDF.
- Minor comments
- Power law fitting now works in Photometry_rest, although A_UV fails. Now need to save the created PDFs and append catalogue with these.
- Fixed bandpass average flux calculations and minor ABmag SED plot autoscaling issues.
- Minor updates to SED_rest_properties storage
- Removed a couple of functions that were commented but are now deprecated.
- Written n-dim PDF class called "PDF_nD". Have also filled in Catalogue and Photometry_rest rest-frame UV property conversion functions, including fesc. This needs to be tested and I'm certain the new convolving bandpass filters in broken - relevant for creating mock photometry and calculating beta.
- Started re-write of Photometry_rest to allow for calculation of rest-frame UV properties.
- Now makes symlinks to SED plots to store in a nice selection folder.
- Fixed SED plotting unit labelling errors. Functions placed in useful_funcs_austind.py
- Plotting generalized further including automated y axes scaling and SNR label positioning for different flux/mag units. There should still be the option to log scale the x axis and the x/y axis labels need re-doing. PDF plotting then needs small updates as well.
- Unit conversion errors fixed and plotting now tested and working for f_nu flux units. Need to test f_lambda -> these flux units should be plotted in log space which will be fun to try and sort out :)
- Upper limit and autoscaling for SED plotting finished and should be generalized. Length of arrow bars and SNR labelling require minor changes.
- PDF annotations now work but plotting aesthetics can be improved. Should also limit PDF plotting to not show below 0 in x axis for z_PDFs
- Merge pull request #73 from duncanaustin98/early_crop_v2
- New early_crop updates (woopsy)
- Merge pull request #71 from duncanaustin98/early_crop
- Colours and legend entries now included and work in SED plotting
- Updated function to convert units of photometric errors. Still remaining issues with plotting upper limits and re-scaling entire plot to appropriate range.
- Plotting now works for ABmag units. Should allow option to plot band widths and errors in black, along with SNR annotations for the raw photometric data. Should also plot expected fluxes from best-fitting SED templates.
- Now allows for PDF peaks to be loaded in appropriately from corresponding SED_results. This is very useful for annotating PDF plots.
- Galaxy.plot_cutouts() now works. Next step is to fix unit plotting errors in SED class.
- Loading in cropped cat now works fully, although need to be careful to not run depths/SED fitting on cropped catalogues if this is not what is intended.
- Masking crop now fixed. Last thing to do before merging back into main is to update and test SED_codes.fit_cat()
- Number of galaxies loaded now works correctly. Catalogue status should be updated with "selection" at some stage.
- Fixed Data.load_wcs() error
- Galaxy.py now loads in required astropy_cosmology
- Updated with basic plotting code. Definitely doesn't work yet and there are still syntax issues to sort out.
- EPOCHS selection sorted, other than minor changes required in Catalogue._append_selection_to_fits and Catalogue.perform_selection. Also need to put in brown dwarf and hot pixel selection, as well as a combined SNR/mask selection
- Okay now it works. And so does the PDF selection without error messages.
- Merge pull request #66 from duncanaustin98/epochs_selection
- Merge pull request #65 from duncanaustin98/PDF_in_SED_result
- Merge branch 'epochs_selection' into PDF_in_SED_result
- PDFs/SEDs and selection all now loads and works correctly. Mask selection should be sped up and PDF selection should be re-written to sample from the stored PDFs
- Everything now loads in appropriately, and this is tested. Improvements required: 1) units for SED fitting properties; 2) phot_rest should be derivable from SED; 3) improve load in speed - NGDEEP2 currently takes 2 mins for 6 bands, 3 SED fitting runs, 19,000 sources
- Updated RGB saving upon Data.__init__. These images aren't turning out too well with the exception of JOF
- When loaded in for the first time, the Data class now makes an RGB image using all the bands if the sci shape is the same for every band using trilogy by default. Galaxy.py also has the option to make RGB .png from created cutouts
- Loads in Redshift_PDFs for 16,000 galaxies in 5 seconds
- Catalogue load in works up to PDF loading. Normalization fixed upon PDF intialization.
- Updated make_cutouts code
- Loading in PDFs/SEDs fixed. Now going through rigorous testing!
- Now saves redshift in SED.h5 file for easy (and EAZY lol) access
- Minor SED_result.py changes
- Written extract_PDFs and extract_SEDs for EAZY (and left as pass for LePhare currently), as well as fully written Catalogue_SED_results.from_fits_cat including PDF and SED loading. Still requires testing! Need to re-run EAZY now with the SEDs .h5 file saving the redshifts.
- Updated EAZY.extract_PDFs
- Updated Data.py to more generally accept different manually entered versions e.g. v11_degrade2 will automatically load from mosaic_1084_wispnathan_degrade2
- Started PDF class construction from catalogue in Catalogue_SED_results.from_fits_cat
- undo a testing change
- Allow different star masks for different bands, and merging artifact masks
- Updated Data.py to apply the n% minimum flux errors correctly. Running new JOF v11 now.
- Updated SED_result class to better format. Next step is to load PDFs and SEDs, although these paths still need to be loaded into the function in a nice way somehow
- Minor updates to reionization.py
- Merge pull request #64 from duncanaustin98/epochs_selection_v2

- fixed
- fix
- Should now work for v9! Tom checking now
- Significantly re-written SED_result.from_gal().
- Pipeline fixed and now running! __str__ PDF needs writing
- Started editing loading in of SED results! This changes propagates to a lot of different places and currently breaks pipeline.py
- New PDF class made. Each SED_result should contain one of these as a property such that it is only created when called and not on SED_result instantiation
- chi squared selection runs and is fast
- Started chi_sq selection functuions in Galaxy object
- Basic EPOCHS SNR selection implemented, although masking takes a little while to run. Now need to make chi2 comparison and z-PDF selection functions.
- Updating mask the first time to catalogue is run now works appropriately!
- Need to fix mask load in. This is impacting the number of galaxies being selected by redwards Lya selection
- Basic Lya bluewards and redwards SNR selection now working, although it takes approx 15s per 10,000 objects (6 bands) to run and these selection columns are not loaded into the galaxy object initially so this currently needs to be re-run each time.
- EAZY SED fit saving now takes of the order 1/40s per galaxy. EAZY issue with loading in h5 when table/SED/zPDF not finished is still an ongoing EAZY problem. Also started Catalogue EPOCHS selection
- Significant updates to readability (and in theory the speed of saving the PDFs/SEDs) of EAZY. Next step is to text this!
- Fixed catalogues up to the point of SED fitting using new Filter class. Now need to re-write EAZY to run one lowz_zmax at a time, and save the outputs in a nicer way! Must update SED_codes load_photometry method to include the mask after updating the phot/err masked arrays in Catalogue.mask()!
- SExtractor now makes initial catalogues with new Filter objects in Instrument
- Updated all instances of self.instrument.bands to self.instrument.band_names. Beginning testing of pipeline now.
- Mid Instrument class re-write. Hopefully should be able to neaten this up considerably.
- Mid update of Instrument class to change self.bands to include an array of filter objects. Must now change all for loops including self.bands or self.instrument to self.band_names or self.instrument.band_names!
- Removed load_SNR function from catalogue creator class.
- SNRs now only in Photometry_obs (where they belong), and are computed (and shown in __str__) correctly except for order 0.01 differences when dealing with negative fluxes. Bang on for positive fluxes. May now proceed with further selection methods in the Catalogue class.
- Now appropriately loads in Masked arrays for photometry/errors. Still need to propagate through SED code input properly. Photometry SNRs slightly different to those in the catalogue
- Turned phot, phot_err in Catalogue_Creator.load_photometry() into np.ma.masked_array(), although need to update Galaxy and Multiple_Galaxy masking by new Catalogue_Creator masking methods. Also need to update the photometry/errors in all galaxy objects (propagating to all photometries contained within) in Catalogue.mask() after masking.
- Catalogue cropping now works fully, including the __deepcopy__ overriding, although I'm not too sure how this actually works.
- Updated EAZY to use one array of lowz_zmax and appropriately load SED fitting results. Also appended Catalogue_Base.py with updated getattr and crop functions.
- Updated Catalogue.__str__() in prep. for selection diagnostics
- Updated __str__ for galaxy, photometry, photometry_obs, and SED_result to see more clearly what is being loaded in when pipeline.py is being run.
- Data.calc_unmasked_area() updated and now works in simple NIRCam masking cases. Not fully tested and should be improved to allow for HST masking in area calculations, as well as splitting areas by deep/shallow regions.
- Finished automasking implementation, although it gets stuck on Regions.parse(sky_region) as it cannot convert string to float: '/'
- Merge pull request #57 from u92876da/better_depths
- Merge branch 'main' into better_depths
- Started automasking process
- Updated multiple_data
- Started Multiple_Data and Multiple_Catalogue classes in prep for COSMOS-Web.
- Removed exception line
- Fixed EAZY to now only add in results to the catalogue from new template set should they not already have been added. Should also split the running of EAZY and subsequent addition into the catalogues by zmax_lowz as well.
- Updated dust examples, and corrected Calzetti k(Î») calculation to extrapolate results for Î» outside usual range.
- Implemented Calzetti+00 dust attenuation law
- Enabled the loading in of bpass v2.3 templates and subsequent calculation of colours (used in EPOCHS-I, Fig.4)
- Fixed catalogues up to the point of SED fitting. Half written str() for instrument and data classes. EAZY now doesn't run properly.
- Fixed make_sex_cats to work for different err maps
- Fixed make_seg_map bug
- Fixed wht_types error when making seg maps
- Masking (including with cluster fields) finished and tested. Still need to update catalogue readme at each catalogue creation step.
- Updated depths and local depth catalogue creation. This now works but paths not correct to run EAZY

- Updated examples and fixed IGM attenuation + BP averaged flux calculations
- Now added an example to plot Inoue+14 IGM grid slices and started the delta beta plot at fixed z for my paper.
- Full Inoue+14 implementation for IGM attenuation of mock SED now works and is tested. Can also now calculate beta in the 10 Calzetti+94 filters from the mock rest and observed frame templates without/with IGM attenuation (there is no theoretical difference here if at fixed redshift).
- Added functionality to produce Inoue14 IGM attenuation grids
- Now added .fits file storing LS_absorption from Inoue2014 in preparation to make grids with galfind
- Added Lyman series absorption table from Inoue et al. 2014
- Now has a Mock_Photometry and a hierarchy of SED classes. Loads and plots filter sets from SVO as well as SED templates together with bandpass averaged fluxes. Instrument unit testing (basic) has been added and there are now a couple of examples as to how to plot things for the new students. Preparing for a large re-write of the Photometry and its child classes. Included now is also a galfind_style.mplstyle sheet.
- Added MIRI wavelengths and FWHMs to band
- Improved beta calculation functionality! Can now calculate for a range of rest frame UV ranges. This functionality still needs to be propagated throughout the entire galfind framework but it currently works when the ranges are hard-coded!
