Photometry Overview
===================

The photometry object is a fundamental component in the analysis of astronomical data. It is used to measure the flux or intensity of light from celestial objects. This measurement is crucial for understanding the properties of stars, galaxies, and other astronomical phenomena. The photometry object provides tools for:

- Extracting light curves
- Measuring magnitudes
- Performing aperture photometry
- Conducting point spread function (PSF) fitting

The photometry object is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets with ease.
