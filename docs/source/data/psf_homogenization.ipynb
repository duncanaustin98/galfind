    "In this notebook, we will have a first look at the `galfind.Data` object. The `Data` object stores all the information pertaining to the photometric imaging in a specific survey, including the paths/extensions to the SCI/WHT/ERR maps for each band as well as a `galfind.Instrument` object which includes the relevant filter information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by first loading the reduced JADES Origins Field (JOF) JWST/NIRCam imaging from Adams et al. 2024. This data must first be loaded from the EPOCHS dropbox, instructions for which can be found in [Getting started / Downloading observational data](../getting_started/downloading_observational_data.rst). If these data products are not currently downloaded and stored in the relevant locations, please take the time to do this now before continuuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, we will practice using the `Data.__init__()` instantiator to load in all the required data. To do this we require the paths/extensions to each of the SCI/WHT/RMS_ERR images, which we will populate in a dictionary."

Luckily there is a useful class method to instantiate the `Data` class, `Data.from_survey_version`, which simplifies things for us a bit. We demonstrate its use below."
