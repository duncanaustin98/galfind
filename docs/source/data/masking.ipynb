    "It is never the case in optical and NIR imaging that data exists without any abnormalities; there are always regions where the output flux is not necessarily reliable. The primary culprits of these are image edges and stellar diffraction spikes, however there may well be other image artefacts present. Over the first few years of JWST/NIRCam operations, which observational astrophysics have been using extensively, these artefacts consist of wisps, claws, and snowballs which are not always properly accounted for in data reduction pipelines. For more information on these types of artefacts, please visit the official JWST user documentation following the hyperlinks for [wisps, claws](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/depreciated-jdox-articles/nircam-claws-and-wisps#gsc.tab=0), and [snowballs](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/depreciated-jdox-articles/data-artifacts-and-features/snowballs-and-shower-artifacts#gsc.tab=0). In the segmentation process, these artefacts may be picked up they can often be bright, however we choose to also mask these specific areas just to make sure.\n",

Obviously this is not the expected behaviour, and so to get rid of these explicit cleaning of these .reg files is required.
