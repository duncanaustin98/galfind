    "In the [previous notebook](data_intro.ipynb), we looked at loading both `Band_Data` and `Data` galfind objects, as well as the basics of image stacking/mosaicing. Since the primary aim of these classes is to produce a [Catalogue](../catalogue.rst) of sources, we will also need to be able to identify one object from another. This is done in a process known as segmentation, and in principle is quite challenging to do well, although we will have a go here."

    "The first technique we will use to segment the data into different sources, which is the default in galfind, is to use the SExtractor parameters from Adams et al. 2023. Before starting this example please ensure that this is installed appropriately on your computer; an explanation of how to install SExtractor can be found [here](../getting_started/installation.rst). Let's start by instantiating our JOF data object as before."
