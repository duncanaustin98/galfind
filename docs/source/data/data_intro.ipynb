The `Data` object is made up of an array of `Band_Data` objects which store all the information pertaining to the photometric imaging in a specific photometric filter, including the paths/extensions to the SCI/WHT/ERR maps as well as a `galfind.Filter` (see the [Instrument](../instrument/instrument.rst) section, and specifically the [Filter](../instrument/filter.ipynb) notebook for more information).\n",

This data must first be loaded from the EPOCHS dropbox, instructions for which can be found in [Getting started / Downloading observational data](../getting_started/downloading_observational_data.rst).
