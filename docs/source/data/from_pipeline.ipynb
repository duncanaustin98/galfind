    "There is one last class method for the Data object that we havn't quite covered yet, `Data.pipeline()` which again just takes `survey` and `version` inputs. This class method is what is used in the EPOCHS pipeline and essentially just chains the cataloguing steps in the previous notebooks together elegantly, skipping those that have already been executed in the past. For further details, please read the previous notebooks in this section if you have not already done so."
