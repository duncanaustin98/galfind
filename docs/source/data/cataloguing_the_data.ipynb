    "# Cataloguing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use for the galfind `Data` object is the creation of photometric catalogues for public and personal use. Once produced, these catalogues can be loaded into the `Catalogue` class to derive specific properties, which we cover in the [next section](../catalogue/catalogue.rst). In this first galfind release, we implement the ability to produce these using SExtractor only, although we aim to include other codes to perform forced photometry in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cataloguing procedure involves many different steps that have been explained in previous notebooks in this section. We outline the steps here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate a blank `Data` object from the reduced imaging\n",
    "2. Produce segmentation maps for each band using SExtractor\n",
    "3. Mask the data (i.e. image edges, stars, artefacts) either manually or automatically\n",
    "4. Perform forced photometry in a set of given apertures in either a single band or an inverse-variance weighted stack of bands.\n",
    "5. Aperture correct the fluxes based on a given model or empirical PSF\n",
    "6. Calculate local depths for each source\n",
    "7. Determine appropriate flux errors based on these depths, accounting for the correlated image noise\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a `Data` object and associated .fits catalogue following these 7 steps in two ways, long (example 1) and short (example 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Producing photometric catalogues\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we will load the same JOF `Data` object we have seen in previous examples."

This is so that, for example, you don't get confused between the products stemming from the previous catalogue and your newly loaded in one. To be clear, the `overwrite` parameter that we have been using simply states whether the pre-existing paths should be overwritten with the new data and NOT whether the data stored in the object should be updated. Preventing stored paths from being overwritten in a particular object, however, does not entirely prevent you from changing the outputs of any methods run from those stored paths as the information is not cached in a single object, rather extracted from the data products when required. Let's try re-producing this SExtractor forced photometric catalogue but instead using the F356W filter for selection in the same object to see what error message we get out of galfind."
