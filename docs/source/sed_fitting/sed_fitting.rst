SED Fitting
===========

Three SED fitting tools are implemented in `galfind`: EAZY, LePhare, and Bagpipes.`
The functionality to calculate SED-fitting properties is also included, with its implementation
outlined in the SED_properties notebook. This is not recommended for Bagpipes, where it is
easier for the user to instead implement this in the Bagpipes basecode.

.. note::

   While EAZY SED fitting is now fully available, LePhare and Bagpipes are still under development.
