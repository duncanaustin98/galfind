    "The most fundamental building block of photometric surveys lies in the bandpass filters used to conduct them. In this example we will learn how to use the `Filter` class which is used in (nearly) every use-case of the `galfind` code. We start by looking at the JWST/NIRCam/F444W band, which is very commonly used in both blank field and cluster surveys."
