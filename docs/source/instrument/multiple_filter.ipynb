    "# The Multiple_Filter object\n",

    "In the [previous notebook](filter.ipynb) we looked at using the `Filter` object; now we will extend this to our `Multiple_Filter` object. This class simply holds a list of Filter objects, but makes loading these in via SVO much easier via its class methods. In addition, these filters are by default sorted from bluest to reddest based on their central wavelength, which reduces potential errors arising from manually ordering these.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by loading in all of the JWST filters in two different ways:\n",
    "1. By looping through all band names for each of the NIRCam and MIRI instruments, making an array of `Filter` objects pulled from the SVO individually.\n",
    "1. Pull all bands from each JWST imaging instrument in one go and add these together."
