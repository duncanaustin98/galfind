Galaxy Object
=============

Overview
--------

A galaxy is a massive, gravitationally bound system consisting of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The term galaxy is derived from the Greek word 'galaxias' (γαλαξίας), literally meaning "milky", a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains our Solar System.

Key Characteristics
-------------------

- **Stars**: Galaxies contain billions to trillions of stars, which are the primary visible components.
- **Stellar Remnants**: These include white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.
- **Interstellar Medium**: Composed of gas (mostly hydrogen and helium) and dust.
- **Dark Matter**: An unknown form of matter that does not emit light or energy, but exerts gravitational forces.

Types of Galaxies
