Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) Fitting
==========================================

Overview
--------

Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting is a technique used in astrophysics to analyze the energy output of astronomical objects across a range of wavelengths. By fitting observed data to theoretical models, researchers can infer physical properties such as temperature, mass, and composition of the objects being studied.

SED fitting can be integrated with synthesizer tools to enhance the analysis by providing more accurate and comprehensive models of the observed data.
