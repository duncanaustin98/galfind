SED Fitting
===========

Overview
--------

Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting is a technique used in astrophysics to model the energy output of astronomical objects across a range of wavelengths. By fitting observed data to theoretical models, researchers can infer physical properties such as temperature, mass, and composition of stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies.
