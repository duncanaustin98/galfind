    "# The Instrument object\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Instrument` class within galfind is an abstract base class containing references to both the `Facility` class that it is a part of and the names of the filters which it uses for photometric imaging. It is parent to 4 Singleton child classes which, in order of increasing wavelength coverage, are: `ACS_WFC`, `WFC3_IR`, `NIRCam`, `MIRI`. The `Facility` class is also an abstract base class parent to 2 Singleton classes, namely `HST` (`ACS_WFC` and `WFC3_IR`) and `JWST` (`NIRCam` and `MIRI`). These base class names are chosen to follow the convention used in the SVO.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, more potential optical or NIR facility/instrument combinations that the user may wish to include in their analysis that are excluded from the 4 above but included in the SVO database. These are, most notably, Spitzer/IRAC, JWST/NIRISS, HST/WFC3_UVIS, HST/NICMOS, and any ground based cameras such as Subaru/HSC or CFHT/MegaCam. There is no particular limitation preventing us from including these other than merely available time, and any contributions to galfind regarding this would be gladly accepted (follow [this link](../getting_started/updates.rst) for more information regarding this). It is worth baring in mind that the most major time consumption here is the handling of `PSF` modelling and subsequent aperture corrections, which we will get onto in both this notebook and [the next](PSF.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Singleton objects\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, we need to first instantiate a Singleton object. For this example, we shall arbitrarily choose `NIRCam`. There is nothing particularly fancy going on here since this is a singleton object. Once we instantiate one instance of NIRCam, any further instances match it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- An `Instrument` child class is stored within each `Filter` object instantiated from the SVO (see [the `Filter` notebook](filter.ipynb)) and contans vital methods for  -->"
